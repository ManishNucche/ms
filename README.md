## 💡 Example SQL Queries (Short Preview)

### Top 5 countries by revenue
```sql
SELECT c.country, SUM(i.total) AS total_revenue
FROM customer c
JOIN invoice i ON c.customer_id = i.customer_id
GROUP BY c.country
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;

---

SELECT g.name, COUNT(*) AS track_count
FROM genre g
JOIN track t ON g.genre_id = t.genre_id
JOIN invoice_line il ON t.track_id = il.track_id
GROUP BY g.name
ORDER BY track_count DESC;

---

SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name,
       SUM(i.total) AS total_spent
FROM customer c
JOIN invoice i ON c.customer_id = i.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
